### User Input

Update the index.html file to be compatible with the script.js file. Specifically there should be a search bar for "search-input", a filter button to trigger the search, and a button to clear the search.

### Planner Response

I'll help you update the index.html file to be compatible with the script.js file by adding the required search elements. Let me first examine both files to understand the current structure.

*Viewed [script.js](file:///Users/emmawingreen/Desktop/tutorial/data-side-hustle3/script.js) *

*Viewed [index.html](file:///Users/emmawingreen/Desktop/tutorial/data-side-hustle3/index.html) *

### Planner Response

Based on the script.js file, I can see it expects specific HTML elements with IDs: `search-input`, `filter-button`, and `clear-button`. The current HTML file has a placeholder for filters but doesn't include these required elements. Let me update the index.html file to add the search functionality.

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

Perfect! I've updated the [index.html](cci:7://file:///Users/emmawingreen/Desktop/tutorial/data-side-hustle3/index.html:0:0-0:0) file to include the required search elements that your [script.js](cci:7://file:///Users/emmawingreen/Desktop/tutorial/data-side-hustle3/script.js:0:0-0:0) file is expecting:

## Changes Made

* **Search input field** with ID `search-input` - allows users to type keywords to search
* **Filter button** with ID `filter-button` - triggers the search functionality 
* **Clear button** with ID `clear-button` - resets the filter to show all rows
* **Label and placeholder text** - provides clear guidance that this searches the "Technical Skills" column

The search functionality will now work as designed in your script.js file:
- Users can enter keywords to filter the Technical Skills column (column index 2)
- The filter button will hide/show rows based on whether the technical skills contain the keyword
- The clear button will restore all rows to be visible

Your HTML file is now fully compatible with the existing JavaScript filtering logic!
